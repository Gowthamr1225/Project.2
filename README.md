## Project Overview

• End-to-end data analytics project focused on chocolate product nutrition and brand insights.
• Combines Python (Pandas), MySQL (XAMPP), and Power BI for complete data workflow.
• Analyzes calories, sugar, fat, and processing levels across multiple brands.
• Builds an interactive Power BI dashboard for clear, data-driven insights.

🎯 **Objectives**

Analyze the nutritional composition of chocolate products.
Categorize items by Calorie and Sugar levels.
Compare brands based on healthiness and product count.
