## Project Overview

• End-to-end data analytics project focused on chocolate product nutrition and brand insights.
• Combines Python (Pandas), MySQL (XAMPP), and Power BI for complete data workflow.
• Analyzes calories, sugar, fat, and processing levels across multiple brands.
• Builds an interactive Power BI dashboard for clear, data-driven insights.

🎯 **Objectives**

Analyze the nutritional composition of chocolate products.
Categorize items by Calorie and Sugar levels.
Compare brands based on healthiness and product count.
Study correlations between nutrients.
Identify and visualize ultra-processed products.
Present insights through interactive Power BI visuals.


🧱 **Data Structure**
Total records: 12,000+ products.
Three structured tables:

1. product_info
Product code, name, brand.
2. nutrient_info
Energy (kcal), sugar, fat, protein, carbohydrates, NOVA group.
3. derived_metrics
Sugar-to-carb ratio, calorie & sugar categories, ultra-processed flag.


🛠️ **Tech Stack**
🐍 Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotib) → Data cleaning, preprocessing, Feature engineering, Visualization.
🗄️ MySQL (XAMPP) → Database, Table Creation, Data Insert and SQL queries.
📊 Power BI Desktop → Dashboard visualization.
📘 Excel → Data validation and export.


📊 **Power BI Visualizations**
• KPI Cards → Average calories, average sugars, ultra-processed count.
• Pie Chart → Sugar category Distribution 
• Donut Chart → Nova_Group Distribution 
• Column Chart → Average Calories Top Brands
• Bar Chart → Top Brands in High Sugars

💡 **Key Insights**
1.Strong positive correlation between calories and sugars.
2.High sugar and high calorie categories overlap significantly.
